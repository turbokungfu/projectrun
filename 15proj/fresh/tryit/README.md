# fresh project

### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.


# I downloaded and started the fresh app. It works, but the editor shows me weird react errors and I've tried all the fixes on the internet. I'm tired from being up awhile and may just look up stuff on the internet. I'll have to get used to the concept of islands.

# after work, I did some more work on this, but the VScode is flagging all the JSX, even though I'm using preact. There doesn't seem to be an easy solution.
